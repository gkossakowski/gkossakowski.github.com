Hello, world! My name is Grzegorz. I'm a writer of [code](http://github.com/gkossakowski) and (aspirationally) of [words](http://gkossakowski.netlify.com/). In the past I worked on systems programming and programming language design, both stepped into by trying to figure out how things truly work.

For over a year, my focus has shifted to Deep Learning and its applications. I believe that with an abundance of deep learning research and progress on synthetic tasks, thinking of applying these advances is a highly creative work.

*The photo above is not of my desk (I wish!). It came with the website template, I was about to delete it and I changed my mind on a whim.*
