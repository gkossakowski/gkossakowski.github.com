I'm experimenting with publishing blog posts here instead on Medium. I'm experimenting with using Gatsby.js.
There's no particular reason I'm thinking of moving off Medium. If I were to pick a weak clue, I would point my
finger at the feeling that Medium's push for social and virality are at odds with high quality of writing.
Medium makes me feel I don't belong to the right club.

So, here I am experimenting with how self-hosted blogging looks like in 2020.
