We’re in another cycle of AI moral panic. We’re about to be flooded with AI content. AI-generated
images will oversaturate us. AI will confuse us en masse. The social fabric, social order, and the
truth are about to be leveled by a savage AI bulldozer.

Moral entrepreneurs are rushing with calls to pause technology development or at least curtail it
through laws. They know the stop-the-world call is unrealistic. But in panics, you don’t spring to a
podium through cold realism. What characterizes AI doomers is limitless imagination for a
catastrophe and a complete lack of vision for ways to avoid it. A mysterious river will sweep us all
like powerless ducklings.

The AI moral panickers conveniently take the most sci-fi scenarios of runaway progress in AI for
granted. There’s no reason to believe it will play out like that. The last time we had an AI moral
panic, it was not about knowledge workers and content but blue-collar workers and manual work.

The year was 2016, self-driving cars and robotic factories of the future were around the corner and
were on a straight course to put tens of millions of people out of work. Where did that notion come
from? A technique called Reinforcement Learning, a subgenre of AI, achieved impressive feats. It was
when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, ranked 2nd in the world, at the “unsolvable” game of Go. The same breed
of AI was mastering arcade games from the 80s at a great clip.

A simple leap would take us from game characters achieving sophisticated tasks to controlling
robots. Gather data, cook it with the same AI magic, and serve superhuman robots. Self-driving cars
were the most hyped instance of the belief in AI robots.

It’s 2023, 7 years later, and except for a few selected zones in a few cities (e.g., San Francisco)
and in limited night hours, there are no self-driving cars in sight. Tens of millions of jobs are
still here.

What happened? The prophecy had flaws. The leap wasn’t simple. Collecting data in real-life
environments was more complex, expensive, and slow. The astounding progress in a virtual environment
where you can play the same game on thousands of computers in parallel at almost zero cost didn’t
translate to the real world. You can’t run the world in parallel, e.g. you can’t have 1000 cars
trying different strategies of taking a left turn on one street at the same time.

OpenAI, one of the best AI research labs, quietly scrapped their robotics research when they
realized that prosaic issues like robotic arms jamming themselves rendered the progress/cost ratio
bleak.

Generative AI differs from robotics. The progress is not a speculative bet, it’s already here. Could
we be wrong about AI again but in some other important way? Sure, we could. Popular discussions
about generative AI miss the pervasive cherry-picking required for landing those breathtaking
pictures or pieces of text. Generative AI is like a slot machine; often giving you mediocre rewards
and occasionally striking a jackpot.

In reality, it’s difficult to use Generative AI in an area where you rank beginner. AI can rewrite
text for you in a certain style, but you need to know it first. You can strike luck with image
generation asked generically, but to consistently get stunning results you need to understand
principles of lighting, be familiar with artists’ styles, principles of composition, etc.

Generative AI is not a tool for the ignorant. Generative AI is just another driving seat. You still
are steering the wheel.
