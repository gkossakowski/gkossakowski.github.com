**Human**: *You're an assistant at a law firm. Please concisely and comprehensibly describe the amendments from June 14, 2023, applied to the EU AI Act. Please then summarise those amendments in simple layperson's terms.*

**Claude, the AI-assistant**:

Here are the amendments from June 14, 2023, to the EU AI Act proposal:

Amendment group 1: Clarification of scope (Article 2)

- Explicitly excludes non-embedded AI systems developed by individuals for personal use.
- Clarifies that AI systems exclusively developed for national security are excluded.

Layman's terms: The law does not apply to simple AI systems an individual creates for themselves, or to AI used specifically for national defense.

Amendment group 2: Addition of general principles (New Article 4a)

- Adds 7 key principles to guide trustworthy AI: human agency, technical robustness & safety, privacy & data governance, transparency, diversity, non-discrimination & fairness, societal & environmental well-being.

Layman's terms: AI should uphold important values like human oversight, safety, privacy, transparency, fairness, and environmental responsibility.

Amendment group 3: Additional requirements for high-risk AI (Articles 8-15)

- Requires risk mitigation systems for "reasonably foreseeable misuse" of AI.
- Requires consideration of the impact on vulnerable groups.
- Requires logging capabilities to ensure traceability.
- Requires meeting appropriate levels of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.
- Requires built-in safeguards for when high-risk AI's accuracy declines.

Layman's terms: Companies making high-risk AI must thoroughly address safety, consider vulnerable people, keep records, meet security/accuracy standards, and ensure AI works even if its accuracy drops.

Amendment group 4: Additional obligations for operators (Articles 16-29)
- Clarifies obligations for providers, deployers, importers, and distributors.
- Requires providers to have a risk management system, quality management system, technical documentation, and EU declaration of conformity.
- Requires deployers to have human oversight, log AI use, get user consent to use AI, report issues to providers.
- Requires cooperation to address risks.

Layman's terms: Companies involved in making or using high-risk AI must have systems to manage risks and quality, documentation, consent, oversight, logging, and teamwork to fix problems.

Amendment group 5: Additional requirements for regulatory sandboxes (Article 53-54)

- Adds more details on establishing and using AI regulatory sandboxes, including priorities for startups/NGOs and public interest AI.
- Allows limited personal data use in sandboxes, with safeguards, for developing AI in the public interest.

Layman's terms: Government programs to test new AI must give priority to small companies/nonprofits with AI for social good. They can briefly use people's data to develop this AI, with privacy protections.

Amendment group 6: Additional obligations for notified bodies (Article 33)

- Requires notified bodies to have permanent staff with expertise in AI, data processing, privacy, and more.
- Requires them to avoid conflicts of interest and protect confidential information.
- Requires them to consider an AI system's intended use and possible misuse.

Layman's terms: Groups that check if AI complies with law must have specialized staff, be impartial, keep information private, consider how AI could be misused.
