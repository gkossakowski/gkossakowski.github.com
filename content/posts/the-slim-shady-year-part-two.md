> “Life without dreaming is a life without meaning.” – Wale

In my previous \[post\](slim-shady-year-part1) about events of 2018, I mentioned that I embarked on Do-It-Yourself-style research into my rapidly progressing adductor tightness. During my research, I concluded that reading raw low-level medical papers wasn't going anywhere. I lacked the big picture and it was unlikely I would build it out myself - the space was simply too large. I need a smarter way to navigate it than pure brute force.

One proven way is to tap into a network of specialists. In my case, it was the network of doctors specializing in sports medicine. I decided to order a few books on the niche subject of elite sports medicine and training in hope generate a fresh list of people to contact. At the same time, I was chatting with my chiropractor friend and I was telling him how my Basel mission wasn't working out. He immediately suggested I should visit a chiropractor named Meersseman. My friend described Meersseman as in equal parts a legend and a medical schismatic.

Meersseman was a founder of a famed AC MilanLab - a high-tech, interdisciplinary research center focused on cultivating the top athletic performance. Through MilanLab, Meersseman pioneered applying predictive analytics (as we know from tech companies) to detailed training customization for each soccer player individually, with fantastic results in players' performance and injury-free longevity. That's the glorious part. He is a fervent believer in "whatever works" approach with disregard to standard of Western medicine, which the less wonderful side.

I was under supervision of some of the best people in conventional medicine in the world and they didn't know what to recommend so I was open to trying something new. I learned from my friend that Meersseman is based in Como, a picturesque city in Northern Italy, popular among wealthy techies from Bay Area and celebrities from LA. Como was a few hours by a direct train connection from Basel and I decided on the spot to go.

However, my schedule at Rennbahnklinik was packed. The whole idea was that I would embark on a super intense combination of physical therapy and training. So I had to talk to my therapist and free up a day for the trip. I thought how I could run this idea by her. It took a lot of convincing to book up otherwise busy people for three months and now I would effectively question her team's skills. Or at least, I worried that could be one way to see it. Still, the utmost priority for me was to try literally anything to finally recover and get to other things in life.

* "I've heard great things about this guy called Meersseman, I feel like we're stuck and I would like for him to see me. What do you think?"
* "Sounds like a good idea to see him. He sounds interesting and maybe will find something we miss. I'm curious what he will say."

I was going to Como next week.

Here, I want to pause and share a tally of physical therapists. I've worked with more than two dozens by this point. There are three reactions you will get if you start throwing ideas for what they could try. The bad ones will not mind your ideas but won't be able run with them either, they're that bad. Good ones will often resist or visibly dislike your melding with their expertise, almost like deep inside they hold a scrap of insecurity. And then you have the great ones, that are forceful when sure and perpetually curious. So the more stuck they are, the more open to experimentation and learning they are. It's your growth mindset right here. And Fabienne was among the best I've worked with.

Back to my trip to Como. I arrived to this cozy, sun-drenched town in Northern Italy around noon. I had some spare time before the appointment and went strolling the town to explore local resutarants. I took this picture of the back patio of one of them:

The view moved me deeply. An all-in effort to recover is fundamentally a very lonely journey and the deserted red rose was a perfect metaphore for my feelings. That picture became one of my strongest memories from my trips to Como.

The appointment at Meersseman's clinic appointment consisted of three parts: a general admission interview, a posture and gait examination, and a half-an-hour-slot with JP Meersseman himself. To cut it to the chase, Meersseman formulated the diagnosis instantly upon seeing me and the results of my posture examination. The verdict: my five-years-old jaw joint (TMJ) injury from a nearly deadly ski accident is causing my leg muscles to tense up. The visible symptoms is my pain/tightness in adductor and rotation in my pelvic. An interesting twist is that rotated pelvic forces other body parts (e.g. lower back) to compensate. That introduces a constant tension in the back and the neck which exacerbate joint-misalignment. Truly spooky at-distance-work. The worrying catch was that I didn't hear _how exactly_ jaw's position could influence my adductor's activity and why it was this muscle and not any other.

I took a train back to Basel the same day. Next morning, I discussed this with Fabienne and she found the hypothesis believable. She has heard of the jaw-pelvic and leg muscles connection before. She didn't know the exact mechanism behind it, either.

I had new hope and a new path to explore. Was it worth going, against all other options, though? Meersseman seemed to be onto something but at the very end of our first appointment he admitted that my case is difficult and he has to think about whether he can help me. He was unsure and I had some serious doubts. At this point, I had an experience of working with over dozens doctors and became immune to too-good-to-be-true diagnosis. So how do you make the decision that this is the option I should take next?

A side note: here I'm offering much more distilled version of my story with Meersseman. If you're reading this, because like me, were desperately researching the Internet for any new clue for your own injury, you might enjoy the fine details I included in week 5 and week 6.

As part of my research on JP Meersseman, I looked him up on Google Books. As a rule of thumb, I find media coverage (e.g. articles in sports magazines) to provide supremely weaker signal-to-noise ratio compared to books. For a simple reason that a book represents a compressed view over a given subject. Hence my "life-hack" is to utilize books as much as possible and Google Books is invaluable in finding the leads. Google Books yielded a particularly promising yield: [The New Science of Elite Performance at Any Age by Jeff Berovic](https://www.amazon.com/Play-New-Science-Elite-Performance/dp/054480998X). On my way to Como, I started reading the book and found this quote:

That tipped me over to try working with the Como-based chiropractor. He had the right kind of bravado to look where others might have not. My job was to both convince him that I'm worthy his attention and at the same time watch out for any trace of snake oil. The problem with common sense it's usally right; I'd remind myself often that stepping to the very edge of medicine requires utmost prudence.
